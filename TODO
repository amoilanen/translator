- Get a translation for a single hardcoded word "valo" when the extension is loaded - OK

- Detect which word is currently selected when the extension is active and try to translate it (define a shortcut?), console.log translation
- Display translation as a popup over the word being clicked
- Enable the user to select the source and target languages for translation and use them
- Re-factor and add tests
